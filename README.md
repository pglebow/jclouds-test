Messing about with JClouds

## TO DO:
1. Create a file with your OpenStack credentials src/main/java/com/glebow/jclouds/config/openstack.
2. Run LocalFileSystemServiceTest to see how this works.

## NOTES:
* You may need to be a member of the Admin group to create containers depending on how OpenStack has been setup.
